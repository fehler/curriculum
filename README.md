Curriculum
==========

In an effort to share best practice and develop the highest quality educational content possible, I’m opening up the process of developing a new BDes (Hons) Interaction Design course, which I’m developing at The Belfast School of Art.

Web design education has, rightly, been criticised for its lack of engagement with industry; I believe sharing course content on GitHub can offer us new ways to engage with industry and with other educational institutes (not necessarily universities).

This is an experiment, there might be elements you disagree with, and that’s fine. If you have alternative ideas that you feel strongly about I’d welcome your input, but please engage in a constructive manner. Working collectively, I believe we can build better curricula, this is intended as a starting point to drive that process. Feel free to <a href="mailto:chris.murphy@ulster.ac.uk?subject=Open Curriculum on GitHub">email me</a> with your thoughts. —[Christopher Murphy](https://twitter.com/fehler)
