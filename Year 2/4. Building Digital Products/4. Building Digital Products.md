##Rationale

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

Through a series of interconnected lectures, seminars and workshops, students are introduced to the wide range of theories and tools that underpin the contemporary digital entrepreneur.

In addition to providing students with a holistic understanding of the nature of entrepreneurship, the module also introduces fundamental product and business-focused content, including: idea generation; market research; intellectual property (IP); business support networks and funding applications; pricing models; time management; and presentation and pitching skills.

+ To demonstrate a clear understanding of digital product design and the commercial opportunities it offers.
