+ __Year:__ 4
+ __Semester:__ 2
+ __Credits:__ 20 Credits
+ __Delivery:__ Lectures, Seminars, Workshops and Self-Directed Study

##Rationale

Design Presentation and Reporting equips students with the skills – both written and verbal – to confidently articulate their ideas, pitching them to an audience in a manner that is both reasoned and persuasive.

The module allows students to expand upon their research skills to further a deeper understanding of the subject area in general, and to help in evidencing concepts, ideas and rationales relating to the work undertaken for the Major Project in the same semester. The module develops advanced analytical skills vital in the rapidly evolving field of interaction design.

The module, which is tightly coupled with the Major Project module, is intended to enable students to develop the pitching skills necessary to present their ideas in an industry context. Equipping them with the abilities required to do this, students make a formal structured presentation that sets out the rationale, analysis, conclusions and critical appraisal of their Major Project.


##Aims

The essential aims of this module are:

+ To introduce students to the skills required to present their work in a clearly structured manner.
+ To develop the necessary skills and methodologies for the creation and presentation of ideas.
